# About

My name is Akilesh Kannan and I like to flip bits. My interests lie in Analog Circuit design and Comp Arch/Org.
I am also a huge supporter of GNU/Linux systems and Open-Source Software.

Here's somethings you should def know about me:

1. Vim is ‚ù§
2. Open-source everything!
3. [Linkin Park](https://www.linkinpark.com/), [Panic! At The Disco](https://panicatthedisco.com/) are my favorite music artists.
4. I [rice](https://github.com/aklsh/dots) my configs in my free time.

Not that I need it, but I do have [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/aklsh/), so
that I can buy a custom domain sometime in the future.
