# About

My name is Akilesh Kannan. I’m currently pursuing a Dual Degree in Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras. My interests lie in Signal Processing, Analog and Digital Circuit design. I also dabble a bit in cryptography and security.  

Here’s somethings you should definitely know about me:

- vim is ♥︎
- open-source everything!
- Linkin Park and Panic! At The Disco are names that spark up my eyes anytime of the day
- i love riced desktops
- [LaTeX >> Word](https://www.facebook.com/groups/763873400640518)

Not that I need it, but I do have [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/aklsh/), so that I can buy a custom domain sometime in the future.  
I’m also a proud Chennaiite :)
