My name is Akilesh Kannan, an undergrad at [IIT Madras](https://iitm.ac.in) My interests lie in Circuit design, FPGA-based solutions and working on the Hardware/Software interface.
I am also a huge supporter of GNU/Linux systems and Open-Source Software _and Hardware_.

Here's somethings you should definitely know about me:

1. Vim >> Emacs.
3. Linkin Park, Panic! At The Disco are my favorite music artists.
4. I rice my configs in my free time. And sometimes put them on r/unixporn :^)

Not that I need it, but I do have Liberapay, <s>so that I can buy a custom domain sometime in the future.</s> so that I can keep the custom domain xD - it would certainly help with domain and hosting costs.
