My name is Akilesh Kannan. You'll usually find me on the internet as `aklsh`. My interests lie mostly in the hardware-software interfaceâ€”low-level software (OS, networking), computer architecture and hardware accelerators. I am also huge supporter of GNU/Linux systems (haven't tried BSDs, so can't comment), Open-Source Software and Open Hardware.

Here's somethings that you can talk to me about:

1. Hardware. All kinds: Processors, Security, GPUs, Laptops, PC Builds etc.
2. TV Shows. Name any english TV show and I've probably watched it.
3. Music. Alternative, Rock, Electronic.
4. Ricing. I sometimes post my rices on r/unixporn.
5. Gaming. Console >> PC gaming. There's just something about a controller with a joystick.
6. Motorsport. I keep up with F1,2,3,E and am an avid fan of Scuderia Ferrari.

Not that I need it, but I do have Liberapay and Ko-fi, which will greatly help in domain and hosting costs.
