My name is Akilesh Kannan and I like to flip bits xD. My interests lie in Circuit design and FPGA-based solutions.
I am also huge supporter of GNU/Linux systems and Open-Source Software _and Hardware_.

Here's somethings you should def know about me:

1. Vim is ‚ù§
2. Open-source everything!
3. Linkin Park, Panic! At The Disco are my favorite music artists.
4. I rice my configs in my free time.

Not that I need it, but I do have Liberapay, <s>so that I can buy a custom domain sometime in the future.</s> so that I can keep the custom domain xD - it would certainly help with domain and hosting costs.
